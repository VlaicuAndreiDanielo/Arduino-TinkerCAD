# Arduino-TinkerCAD

This repository contains Arduino projects that you can test both on the TinkerCAD platform and with a real Arduino UNO. The projects include:

1. **RGB LED Project**
2. **LED Matrix Projects (with 3 versions of code)**

---

## How to Use

1. **Download or Clone the Repository:**  
   Clone this repository or download the desired `.ino` files for the RGB LED project and one of the LED Matrix projects.

2. **Assemble the Hardware:**  
   Set up your circuit on a breadboard according to the connection summaries above. Double-check that all LEDs, resistors, and wires are connected correctly.

3. **Upload the Code:**  
   Click the **Upload** button in Arduino IDE to program your Arduino board.

4. **Observe the Result:**
   - **RGB LED Project:** Watch the RGB LED cycle through the 72 fading sequences.
   - **LED Matrix Projects:** See the different light animations as dictated by the selected version’s code.

## Final Notes

- You can adjust the speed of the animations by modifying the delay values in the code.
- When using simulation platforms like TinkerCAD, ensure that the pin assignments and resistor values match those described above.
- Check the polarity of the LEDs and the ratings of the resistors (220 Ω typically) to ensure correct operation.

Happy tinkering and enjoy creating unique lighting effects with your Arduino!

## Future Updates

Stay tuned for more projects! I am continuously working on new and exciting Arduino projects that will be added in the coming days. Keep an eye on this repository for updates!
